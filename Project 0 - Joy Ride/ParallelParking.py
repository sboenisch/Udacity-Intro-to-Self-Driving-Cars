# # Joy Ride - Part 3: Parallel Parking
# In this section you will write a function that implements the correct sequence of steps required to parallel park a vehicle.
# 
# NOTE: for this segment the vehicle's maximum speed has been set to just over 4 mph. This should make parking a little easier.

# If you have never heard of WASD keys, please check out this [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow_keys#WASD_keys).
# 
# ## Instructions to get started
# 
# 1. Run the `SETUP CELL` below this one by pressing `Ctrl + Enter`. 
# 1. Click the button that says "Load Car Simulator". The simulator will appear below the button.
# 1. Run the cell below the simulator, marked `CODE CELL` (hit `Ctrl + Enter`). 
# 1. Try to drive the car using WASD keys. You might notice a problem...
# 1. Press the **Reset** button in the simulator and then modify the code in the `CODE CELL` as per the instructions in TODO comments. 
# 1. When you think you've fixed the problem, run the code cell again. 
# 
# **NOTE** - Depending on your computer, it may take a few minutes for the simulator to load! Please be patient.
# 
# ### Instructions to Reload the Simulator
# Once the simulator is loaded, the `SETUP CELL` cannot be rerun, or it will prevent the simulator from appearing. If something happens to the simulator, you can do the following:
# - Go to Jupyterâ€™s menu: Kernel --> Restart and Clear Output
# - Reload the page (Cmd-R)
# - Run the first cell again
# - Click the Green `Load Car Simulator` button again

# Before/After running any code changes make sure to click the button "Restart Connection" above first.
# Also make sure to click Reset in the simulator to refresh the connection.
# You need to wait for the Kernel Ready message.

# # Submitting this Project!
# Your parallel park function is "correct" when:
# 
# 1. Your car doesn't hit any other cars.
# 2. Your car stops completely inside of the right lane.
# 
# Once you've got it working, it's time to submit. Submit by pressing the `SUBMIT` button at the lower right corner of this page.
